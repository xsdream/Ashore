# [A1]-Airbnb embraces home working with equal pay model

**【Para.1】** Airbnb staff will be able to work from almost anywhere they want, the company has announced, and they won’t see their pay docked if they move outside metropolitan areas.


**【Para.2】** The new model will apply to staff in the US, but also those in the UK and other countries. To make it work, the company said it would focus in-person collaboration on roughly quarterly get-togethers and aim to bundle work together into two product releases a year, its chief executive and co-founder, Brian Chesky, said.


**【Para.3】** “We want to hire and retain the best people in the world (like you),” Chesky wrote in an email to staff. “If we limited our talent pool to a commuting radius around our offices, we would be at a significant disadvantage. The best people live everywhere, not concentrated in one area. And by recruiting from a diverse set of communities, we will become a more diverse company.



**【Para.4】** “Now, I understand the anxiety of not seeing people in an office– – how do you know if your employees are doing their jobs when you can’t see them? For me, it’s simple: I trust you, and flexibility only works when you trust the people on your team.”



**【Para.5】** Employees will not be entirely free to move as they see fit. For tax reasons, they will need to have a permanent base in the country they’re hired in. If they work overseas, they can spend no more than 90 days a year in any given country, and are responsible for handling their own work authorisation. And they do still need to consider time zones, and think about how to actually get to the gatherings.



**【Para.6】** Crucially, however, the company will no longer pay people based on regional differences. “Starting in June, we’ll have single pay tiers by country for both salary and equity,” Chesky said. “If your pay was set using a lower location-based pay tier, you’ll receive an increase in June.”



**【Para.7】** Other companies that have embraced remote work have been less generous. Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft all ask employees to take a pay cut if they move somewhere with a substantially lower cost of living.



**【Para.8】** Airbnb is recovering from a difficult pandemic. The company, whose bookings plummeted as international travel fell away, laid off a quarter of its headcount in May 2020, scaling back its investments in hotels and ultra-luxury apartments and pausing plans to move into transportation and content creation.



**【Para.9】** It went public in December 2020, an uncomfortable period for a travel-focused company, but has maintained a market cap of around $100bn in the 18 months since.

**爱彼迎 采用同工同酬模式拥抱在家工作**


**【第 1 段】** Airbnb 的员工几乎可以在他们想要的任何地方工作，该公司宣布，如果他们搬到大都市区以外，他们的工资不会被扣减。



**【第 2 段】** 新模式将适用于美国的员工，但也适用于英国和其他国家的员工。该公司首席执行官兼联合创始人布赖恩·切斯基(Brian Chesky)表示，为了使其发挥作用，该公司表示将把面对面合作的重点放在大约每季度举行一次的聚会上，并旨在将合作捆绑到一年中的两个产品发布中。



**【第 3 段】** “我们希望雇佣和留住世界上最优秀的人才（比如你），”切斯基在给员工的电子邮件中写道。 “如果我们将人才库限制在办公室周围的通勤范围内，我们将处于显着劣势。最优秀的人无处不在，而不是集中在一个地区。通过从多元化的社区中招聘，我们将成为一家更加多元化的公司。



**【第 4 段】** “现在，我理解了在办公室见不到人的焦虑——你怎么知道你的员工在你看不到他们的情况下是否在做他们的工作？对我来说，这很简单：我信任你，只有当你信任团队中的人时，灵活性才有效。”



**【第 5 段】** 员工不会完全自由地按照他们认为合适的方式移动。出于税收原因，他们需要在被雇用的国家/地区拥有永久基地。如果他们在海外工作，他们每年在任何特定国家/地区的停留时间不超过 90 天，并负责处理自己的工作许可.他们仍然需要考虑时区，并考虑如何真正参加聚会。



**【第 6 段】** 然而，至关重要的是，公司将不再根据地区差异向员工付款。 “从 6 月开始，我们将按国家/地区为工资和股权制定单一薪酬等级，”切斯基说。 “如果您的工资是使用较低的基于位置的工资等级设定的，那么您将在 6 月份获得加薪。”



**【第 7 段】** 其他接受远程工作的公司就没有那么慷慨了。谷歌、亚马逊、苹果、Facebook 和微软都要求员工在搬到生活成本低得多的地方时减薪。



**【第 8 段】** Airbnb 正在从一场艰难的大流行中恢复过来。由于国际旅行减少，该公司的预订量直线下降，该公司于 2020 年 5 月裁减了四分之一的员工，缩减了对酒店和超豪华公寓的投资，并暂停了进军交通和内容创作的计划。



**【第 9 段】** 它于 2020 年 12 月上市，这对一家专注于旅游的公司来说是一段不愉快的时期，但在此后的 18 个月里，它的市值一直保持在 1000 亿美元左右。
