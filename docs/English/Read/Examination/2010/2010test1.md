## [test1]

**【Para.1】** The longest bull run in a century of art-market history ended on a dramatic note with a
sale of 56 works by Damien Hirst, “Beautiful Inside My Head Forever”, at Sotheby’s in London
on September 15th 2008. All but two pieces sold, fetching more than £70m, a record for a sale by
a single artist. It was a last victory. As the auctioneer called out bids, in New York one of the
oldest banks on Wall Street, Lehman Brothers, filed for bankruptcy.

**【Para.2】** The world art market had already been losing momentum for a while after rising
vertiginously since 2003. At its peak in 2007 it was worth some $65 billion, reckons Clare
McAndrew, founder of Arts Economics, a research firm — double the figure five years earlier.
Since then it may have come down to $50 billion. But the market generates interest far beyond its
size because it brings together great wealth, enormous egos, greed, passion and controversy in a
way matched by few other industries.

**【Para.3】** In the weeks and months that followed Mr. Hirst’s sale, spending of any sort became
deeply unfashionable. In the art world that meant collectors stayed away from galleries and
salerooms. Sales of contemporary art fell by two-thirds, and in the most overheated sector, they
were down by nearly 90% in the year to November 2008. Within weeks the world’s two biggest
auction houses, Sotheby’s and Christie’s, had to pay out nearly $200m in guarantees to clients who
had placed works for sale with them.

**【Para.4】** The current downturn in the art market is the worst since the Japanese stopped buying
Impressionists at the end of 1989. This time experts reckon that prices are about 40% down on
their peak on average, though some have been far more fluctuant. But Edward Dolman, Christie’s
chief executive, says: “I’m pretty confident we’re at the bottom.”

**【Para.5】** What makes this slump different from the last, he says, is that there are still buyers in the
market. Almost everyone who was interviewed for this special report said that the biggest problem
at the moment is not a lack of demand but a lack of good work to sell. The three Ds — death, debt
and divorce — still deliver works of art to the market. But anyone who does not have to sell is
keeping away, waiting for confidence to return.
